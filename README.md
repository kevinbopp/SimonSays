# Simon Says
Simple VisualBasic color-clicking game I made back in high school; first game ever made. Only easy mode is implemented. This serves as an archive of my **code** only, NOT the built game.

To download a playable build of the game, retrieve the download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZPbMignEAOjvukKafiJBwzeZ_oiEwKGF/view?usp=sharing). Alternatively, it is available on my website for download at [kevincbopp.com](https://www.kevincbopp.com).
